# FAQs â€“ Material for MkDocs Insiders

## General

__I'm thinking of becoming a sponsor. How can I reach out?__ 
>  If you have sponsoring-related questions and would like to contact us before  
to sponsoring, we are happy to answer all your non-technical questions via 
email at sponsors@squidfunk.com. 

__Can I sponsor without a GitHub account?__
> No, you cannot sponsor without a GitHub account. As we use GitHub Sponsors for
all transactions and access management, when becoming a sponsor, you have to do 
this on GitHub on our [sponsors page] with your individual or organizational 
account. 

  [sponsors page]: https://github.com/sponsors/squidfunk/

__Can I sponsor privately?__
> Yes, you can. Just set your sponsoring to private. If you don't want any 
connections to your organization, you can sponsor using a [bot account].

__Which tier should I choose?__
> The tiers are divided into non-commercial and commercial use. If you are an 
individual using Material for MkDocs for private or surely non-commercial 
open-source projects, you have two tiers to choose from, depending on the sites 
you want to build. For organizations using Material for MkDocs, we offer three 
different commercial tiers, which are also chosen depending on the number of 
sites being built.

__Why is Material for MkDocs a subscription model?__
> Material for MkDocs at its core is free and always will be. This project was 
created for open source, and we love to give back and be part of this open 
community. That being said, as our project grew over the last years, the 
overhead started to extend our time we could spent working on this project for 
and had to decide if we would stop working on it or invest more time into it. 
We decided to give GitHub Sponsors a try and integrated the subscription model, 
which is a great way to combime the open source character and the a paid full 
service product. While the basic version is still open for everyone, the 
Insiders' version provides access to additional features, and the compensation 
we receive through this program helps us dedicate more time and resources to the 
project. The subscription model is designed based on our funding goals, and once 
these funding goals are reached, these Insiders features will be released to the 
public, and the open-source community can benefit from them once again.

__Do you provide additional support for Material for MkDocs Insiders?__
> Yes, we provide non-technical support related to sponsoring via email at
sponsors@squidfunk.com for Material for MkDocs Insiders to all our sponsors. For
technical questions, please submit an issue openly on our [issue tracker] or 
start a discussion on our [discussion board]. Issues and diskussions from our 
sponsors will be prioritized.

## Getting started

__I sponsored with a one-time or custom amount. Do I get access to Insiders?__
> No, please note that a minimum of $15 per month is required to become eligible 
for Insiders. While GitHub Sponsors also allows sponsoring with lower amounts or 
one-time amounts, access to Insiders is only granted for ongoing sponsorships at 
the minimum monthly amount due to technical reasons.

__How do I get access to the repository?__
> If you sponsored with your __individual account__, you should have received an 
email invitation to the private Material for MkDocs Insiders repository right 
after you initiated your sponsorship. Simply accept the invitation within seven 
days to gain access.

> If you sponsored using an __organization account__, please note that we need an 
individual account that we can list as a collaborator of the private Insiders 
repository. After you initiate your sponsorship, please send us an email at 
sponsors@squidfunk.com with the name of the individual or bot account. Once you 
provide us with this information, we will add the account as a collaborator, and 
after you accept the invitation, you will gain access to the repository.

> In case you lost the email or the invitation link expired, please contact us, 
the maintainers, at sponsors@squidfunk.com.

__Why can't my organizational account get access to Insiders?__
> Currently, it is not possible to grant access to an organizational account, as 
GitHub only allows for adding individual user accounts. We are working on a 
solution ourselfs to simplify access to organizations. For now, to ensure that 
access is not tied to a particular individual GitHub account, we suggest
creating a bot account, i.e., a GitHub account that does not belong to a 
specific individual (as they might change) but is listed as the owner of the 
organizational account and using this account for sponsorship.

__Do I need to fork the repository?__
> The answer is both no and yes. If you are using the Insiders version as an 
individual, you can work directly with the private repository, as you do not 
need to share the Insider features with your team. If you are working with a 
team, it is best to create a private fork using the individual account that was 
listed as a collaborator by the maintainers of Material for MkDocs and grant 
access to all members of your organization.

## Payment & billing

__Do you offer discounts, e.g., student discounts, for the Insiders version?__
> Unfortunately, we do not offer any discounts for the Material for MkDocs 
Insiders program. To ensure that everyone can afford the Insiders program and 
keep the barrier as low as possible, we have set prices as low as $15/month for 
individual non-commercial use.

__Do you offer free Insiders access to Open Source projects?__
> No, we do not offer free access to our Material for MkDocs Insiders version. 
We understand that non-profit organizations may have limited budgets and may 
need to prioritize their spending on other projects or organizations. It's 
important to note that Material for MkDocs is maintained by a small team, 
investing a lot of time and resources into constantly improving this project. 
Material for MkDocs and its core features are available for free to the 
community through our open-source model. Therefore, Material for MkDocs itself 
is already free.

> We offer an affordable "Individual" tier starting at $15/month, which is meant 
for individuals and non-profit organizations using Material for MkDocs to build 
1-2 sites for non-commercial purposes. This tier provides access to all new 
features, allowing you to benefit from our ongoing development efforts.

__How can I set my billing to monthly or yearly?__
> You can sponsor on a monthly or yearly basis. The [billing cycle] is an 
account-level setting and can be easily changed by you in your account. If, for 
some reason, you cannot make this change, you can create a dedicated bot account 
with a yearly billing cycle on GitHub, which you only use for sponsoring (some 
sponsors already do that).

> If you have any problems or further questions, please reach out to 
sponsors@squidfunk.com.

__Can we get an invoice for our sponsorship?__
> Unfortunately, we can't provide you with an invoice for your sponsoring 
transaction, as GitHub Sponsors handles all transactions for us. However, GitHub
automatically sends you a payments receipt via mail once the sponsorship is 
active. 

__Can we become a sponsor using another platform?__
> Yes, you can also support Material for MkDocs on other platforms. We have
integrated some of our sponsoring tiers on [Ko-fi], which allows you to sponsor 
using other payment options like PayPal.

__For how long is my sponsorship valid?__
> Your sponsorship is valid for as long as you continue to pay the monthly or 
yearly fee. If you choose to cancel your sponsorship, you will lose access to 
the Insiders version and will be removed as a collaborator from the private 
repository.

__Can I switch between different sponsorship tiers?__
> Yes, you can switch between different sponsorship tiers at any time. Simply go 
to the GitHub Sponsors page and [upgrade your sponsorship] level accordingly.

__What happens if I reach my sponsoring limit for the current tier?__
> If you reach your sponsoring limit for the current tier, you will need to 
[upgrade your sponsorship] to a higher tier to continue using the Insiders 
version.

__Do you offer refunds for sponsoring payments?__
> Unfortunately, we do not offer refunds for sponsoring payments. If you have 
any issues with payment, please contact the GitHub support team, as they handle 
all transactions for us. 

## Terms & conditions

__What is considered commercial use?__
> Commercial use refers to any use of the software for a business or for-profit 
purpose. This includes any use by a corporation or other organization, whether 
or not they are generating revenue directly from the software. We offer 
different pricing tiers for commercial use, each tailored to the needs of 
different types of businesses. It's important to note that internal use of the 
software within your organization is also considered commercial use. 

__What is considered non-commercial use?__
> Non-commercial use of our Material for MkDocs refers to any use that is not 
for a business or for-profit purpose. This includes individuals using the 
Material for private or purely non-commercial open-source projects. We offer two 
different tiers for non-commercial use, depending on the number of sites you 
want to build.  

__What does your fair use policy mean?__
> At Insiders, we have a fair use policy to help ensure that our software is 
used in a way that benefits both our users and our team. Our policy includes the 
following guidelines:

> - Please refrain from __distributing the source code__ of Insiders. While you 
may use the software for public, private, or commercial projects and may 
privately fork or mirror it, we ask that you keep the source code private. This 
is important to our sponsorware strategy, which helps us fund ongoing 
development and support of the software.

> - As our sponsorship tiers are based on the number of sites you want to build, 
please make sure to [upgrade your sponsorship] once your current sponsoring tier 
limit has been reached. 

> - If you choose to cancel your subscription to Insiders, you will be 
automatically removed as a collaborator and will no longer receive future 
updates. However, you are __welcome to continue using the latest version__ that 
was available to you at the time of cancellation for as long as you like. Please 
note that GitHub deletes private forks, so you may want to take steps to ensure 
that you have a backup of the software if necessary.

__Does the Insiders version run under a different license?__
> No. Whether you're an individual or a company, you may use Material for 
MkDocs Insiders precisely under the same terms as Material for MkDocs, which are 
given by the [MIT license].

__Can outside collaborators run and build the documentation locally without having access to Insiders?__
> Yes. Insiders is compatible with Material for MkDocs. Almost all new features
and configuration options are either backward-compatible or implemented behind
feature flags. When working with outside collaborators, it should rarely be
necessary to change the general appearance of your site. Most Insiders features 
enhance the overall experience, e.g., by adding icons to pages or providing a
feedback widget. While these features add value for your site's users, they
should be optional for previewing when making changes to content. Currently,
the only content-related features in Insiders that can't be properly previewed
by non-Insiders users are: [Annotations] and [Card grids].

> This means that outside collaborators are able to build the documentation
locally with Material for MkDocs, and when they push their changes, your CI
pipeline will build it with Insiders. When using built-in plugins that are
exclusive to Insiders, it's recommended to split configuration into a base
`mkdocs.yml` and one with plugin overrides via [configuration inheritance]. See 
the [getting started guide] for more information.

## Privacy

__How can I keep my sponsorship private?__
> As we value the privacy of our sponsors, we have a recommended process for 
organizations that want to become a sponsor. To ensure your privacy, we advise 
you to create a new GitHub bot account that is not tied to an individual and is 
listed as an owner of your GitHub organization. This bot account can then be 
used to become a private sponsor. All information will be kept confidential, and 
only the bot account and us maintainers can view your sponsorship. Any 
commercial benefits, such as logo placement, are optional and can be opted in or 
out at any time.

__Can you sign our NDA?__
> Unfortunately, we cannot sign any form of NDA or vendor sheets. As a small 
team working on Material for MkDocs, we have limited resources and do not have 
the capability to thoroughly review and wholeheartedly sign such an agreement.
