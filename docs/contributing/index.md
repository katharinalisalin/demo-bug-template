# Contributing

Material for MkDocs is an actively maintained and constantly improved project 
that caters to a diverse user base with varying backgrounds and needs. In order
to effectively address the needs of all our users, evaluate requests, and fix 
bugs, a lot of work from us maintainers is required.

## How to contribute

We have invested quite a lot of time in creating better templates for our
[issue tracker], optimizing the processes for our users to report bugs, request
features or changes, contribute to the project or exchange with our community. This section of
the documentation explains each process.

  [issue tracker]: https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/issues

## Before contributing

Our community is vast and includes many curious people who open new discussions 
or issues multiple times a day and are filling the issue tracker or the 
discussion board with a lot of valuable knowledge. Therefore, we see our issue 
tracker and the discussion board as a knowledge base that is an important 
addition to our documentations and brings value to both new and experienced 
users of Material for MkDocs.

Before opening a discussion, an issue or commenting

- Issues: Is this the right issue template for my request?
- Discussions: Is my request related to this discussion or should I open a new one and link the old one?
- Blog post: Is my comment directly related to this blog post or should I open a discussion and link the blog post?


issues and discusion can't be deleted â€“ they will stay in this project _forever_, for _everybody_ to read

### Code of Conduct
