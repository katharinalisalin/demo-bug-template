# Contributing

Material for MkDocs is an actively maintained and constantly improved project 
that serves a diverse user base with varying backgrounds and needs. In order to 
effectively address the needs of all our users, evaluate requests, and fix bugs, 
we maintainers need to put in a lot of work.

Our community is pretty big and includes many active users who open new 
discussions or issues multiple times a day, filling the [issue tracker] or the 
[discussion board] with a lot of valuable knowledge. As such, we consider our 
issue tracker and discussion board to be a knowledge base that is an important 
addition to our [documentation], and brings value to both new and experienced 
users of Material for MkDocs. 

## How to contribute

We have invested a lot of time in creating better templates for our
[issue tracker], optimizing the processes for our users to report bugs, request
features or changes, contribute to the project, or exchange with our community. 
This section of the documentation explains each process.

## Before contributing

To ensure that our issue tracker and discussion board remain __structured__, 
__searchable__ and __easy to follow__, it is mandatory to ensure you are 
contributing in the right context before submitting an issue, opening a 
discussion or commenting on existing discussions or subpages.

### Before submitting an issue, review:

- Am I using the right issue template for my [request], [report], or [contribution]?           
- Have I checked if a similar issue or request has already been submitted?
- Did I fill out every field as requested?
- Did I provide all additional information others might need to comprehend my request?

 [request]: https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=03-request-a-change.yml
 [report]: https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=01-report-a-bug.yml
 [contribution]: https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/issues/new?assignees=&labels=change+request&template=04-add-a-translation.yml&title=Add+translations+for+...

### Before asking a question, reconsider:

- Is there an open discussion on the topic of my request?
- Does my question fit the direction of the discussion, or should I open a new discussion?
- Is my topic a question for the discussion boards, or is it a bug report or idea request that require a new issue?
- Did I provide the community with all the necessary information to comprehend my question?
- Have I checked if my question has been answered before?

### Before leaving a comment, rethink:

- Is my comment directly related to the topic of this page, e.g., blog post or discussion?
- Is it a comment or a request?
- Should I use the discussion board for my request or comment instead?
- Does my comment add value to the conversation?
- Is my comment respectful and constructive?
