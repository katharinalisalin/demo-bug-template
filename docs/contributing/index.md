# Contributing

Material for MkDocs is an actively maintained and constantly improved project 
that caters to a diverse user base with varying backgrounds and needs. To 
effectively address these needs of all our users, evaluate requests, and fix 
bugs, a lot of work from us maintainers is required. 

To optizime the process and make it more efficient for our users to report, 
request, submit to the project or exchange with our community, we have created 
new forms or updated existing ones in our [issue tracker]. This following guide 
will give you an overview of the options and lead you to the guides, which fit 
your needs.

## Requesting

If you would like to request a new feature or change to the project, you can 
submit a change request to our GitHub repository. If you would like to implement 
a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first to be 
sure that it is of use to everyone, as Material for MkDocs is highly 
opinionated. Please consider what kind of change it is:

## Exchanging

there's no need to open an issue as


 and would like to get in contact with the community, you have 
two options.

- [discussion board]: Our discussion boars the first

## Submitting

* For a **major feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so
  that it can be discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our
  efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so
  that it is successfully accepted into the project.

* **Small features and bugs** can be crafted and directly submitted as a pull
  request. However, there is no guarantee that your feature will make it into
  the `master`, as it's always a matter of opinion whether it benefits the
  overall functionality of the project.
