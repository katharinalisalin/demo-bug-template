# Adding a translation

Material for MkDocs supports 50+ languages with the help of community
contributions. New features or changes often require updated translations, so 
it's important to keep all translations up-to-date. For us maintainers it's 
impossible to update all translations ourselfes (we just don't speak 50+ 
languages), so we rely on contributors to update translations incrementally.

If you notice a missing translation in your language or would like to add a new 
language, we have created a process for you to help Material for MkDocs to 
become even more international.

## Before creating a translation issue

Before you invest time into your contribution, it is essential to check the a view things:

### List of supported languages

There are already 50+ languages on the list 

### Open translation issue

Test

## Translation guide




If you find a missing translation in your language, please follow these guidelines to assist in the process:

1.  Fork the repository.

2.  Open up the [translation file for your language] as well as the
    [English translations], as they are always up-to-date.
    
3.  Compare the languages side-by-side and add the missing translations.

    __Important__: add only the translations that are different from the 
    defaults, e.g., if your language is left-to-right, don't add the `direction` 
    translation, as English is left-to-right as well.
    The following translations are for technical purposes and __should not be 
    updated__, so if they're missing from your language, it's for a good reason:

    - `search.config.lang`
    - `search.config.pipeline`
    - `search.config.separator`

3.  Create a PR (see below) with your changes.
