# Feature suggestion form 

The documentation for Material for MkDocs is spread across more than 20 pages 
and covers information about its features, configurations, and everything you 
need to take advantage of Material for MkDocs' full capabilities. If you have 
found a bug or see room for improvement in the documentation, please submit an 
issue to our public  [issue tracker], by following the 
__docs reporting guide__.
  [issue tracker]: https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/issues


## Before creating a feature request

When adding a new feature or changing the behavior of an existing one, the 
following things have to be considered:

- [ ] The new feature is not incompatible with one of the existing features
- [ ] The new feature can (ideally) be used together with all existing features
- [ ] The new feature can be implemented in a way that it is accessible
- [ ] The implementation follows the principle of progressive enhancement
- [ ] The implementation works on all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] The implementation works on all modern browsers (nope, not IE)
- [ ] The new feature can be implemented with reasonable effort
- [ ] The new feature matches the overall "tone" of this project
- [ ] The new feature is useful to the majority of users
- [ ] The new feature is easy to use for authors







- Open a discussion on the discussion board and ask the community, if the feature 
would benefit more people than yourself (use this tag????)
- Make sure it is a feature that needs to be implemented by Material for MkDocs 
- Do other template provide this feature? Would be a great showcase



## Docs issue template

Reporting a bug in the documentation differs from reporting a bug in the code. 
Please thoroughly read the following __docs reporting guide__ before creating a 
new issue to report a bug or improvement in the documentation.

### Title

A great issue title should be a short, one-sentence description of the bug and 
contain all relevant information. The title should start with "Docs:" and 
include relevant keywords to make searching for the issue faster for the 
community.

| <!-- --> | Example  |
| -------- | -------- | 
| :material-check:{ style="color: #4DB6AC" } __Clear__ | Docs: wrong feature flag code.action
| :material-close:{ style="color: #EF5350" } __Unclear__ | Docs: Missing information 
| :material-close:{ style="color: #EF5350" } __Generic__ | Bug

### Description

Provide a clear and concise summary of the bug you encountered in the 
[Material for MkDocs documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material).
Explain why you think the documentation contains a bug or needs improvement, and 
also explain its impact. 

-   __Keep it short and concise__ – if the bug and it's impact can be precisely 
    explained in one or two sentences, perfect. Don't eleborate, as maintainers 
    and future users will be grateful for having to read less.

-   __One bug at a time__ – if you encountered multiple unrelated bugs on 
    different sites of the documentation, please create separate issues for them. 
    Don't report them in the same issue, as this makes identifying the bugs difficult.

> __Why we need this__: in order for us to understand the problem you have found 
> or the clarification the documentation needs, we ask for a decription of the bug.


### Links to the documentation

Now, include the link to the specific section of the documentation you described 
above, and make sure you link to the sub-pages and anchor the headings directly.

> __Why we need this__: providing the link to the documentation helps us 
> understand which sections of our documentation need to be adjusted, extended, 
> or overhauled.

### Improvement proposals

At this point, you have provided us with a bug description and the link to the 
specific section of the documentation. Now, you can help us maintainers by 
providing an improvement proposal for our documentation. If you have found a 
solution, workaround or a way to fix the bug, you can help other users to 
temporarily mitigate the problem before we maintainers can fix the bug in our 
documentation.

> __Why we need this__: improvement proposals can help us maintainers to 
> migrate bug fixes faster and more efficiantly and therefore benefits the 
> entire community.

### Checklist

Thanks for following the docs reporting guide and creating a high-quality docs 
bug report. This section ensures that you have read this guide and have worked 
to your best knowledge to provide us with every piece information we need to 
improve the Material for MkDocs documentation.

__We'll take it from here.__
