# Change request
As Material for MkDocs is quite large project and serves a wide range of users 
with different requests.


Change requests can be features, updates or anything in this direction.

Material for MkDocs is a powerful tool for creating beautiful and functional 
technical documentation. As the project is quite large, maintaining it can be 
challenging. That's why we have created this feature request guide to help users 
understand the process of considering and implementing new features.

We understand that Material for MkDocs serves a wide range of users and use 
cases, which is why it is important to follow this guide before submitting a 
feature request. This guide will explain the reasoning behind our decisions and 
the criteria we use when evaluating new feature suggestions. By following this 
guide, users can ensure that their feature request is compatible with existing 
features, accessible, and works well on all screen sizes and modern browsers.

We highly appreciate any contributions from the community, but we kindly ask you 
to take the time to read this guide before submitting your feature request. This 
way, you can help us understand your idea and how it will benefit the community, 
and we can work together to make Material for MkDocs even better.
