# Change request

Material for MkDocs is a powerful tool for creating beautiful and functional 
technical documentation. However, as the project is quite large, it can be 
challenging to maintain and add new features and functionalities. We understand 
that our project serves a wide range of users and use cases, which is why we 
have created this change request guide. This guide explains the reasoning behind 
our decisions and the criteria we use when evaluating new ideas.

We highly value contributions from our community, and we kindly ask you to take 
the time to read the following guidelines before submitting your change request in 
the [issue tracker]. This will help us understand your idea and how it will 
benefit the community, and we can work together to make Material for MkDocs even 
better.

## Before submitting an idea

Before you take your time to fill out and submit a change request, we advise you 
to do some preliminary work and ask yourself some questions to determine if your 
idea can be implemented in Material for MkDocs. For this, we have created the 
following questions:

### Implementation in dependencies

__Should your idea be implemented in Material for MkDocs or in other dependencies?__ 
Make sure your change request is directly related to Material for MkDocs. Our 
project relies on many different projects and has dependencies, which is why you 
must ensure your idea won't need to be implemented in another project.

  - [MkDocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs#mkdocs)
  - 

### Existing feature

__Did you see your idea executed before?__
You may have already seen your idea implemented or executed in other static site 
generators or themes. In that case, retake a look at the implementation and 
explain your idea based on this and showcase the project containing this idea in 
the required section of the change request. This helps us understand your idea 
more precisely and get an idea of what needs to be done.

### Discussion board

__Does your idea benefit the community?__
Our discussion board is the best place to connect with our community. When 
developing new ideas, it's important to seek input from others and consider 
alternative viewpoints. This approach can help in identifying the most 
efficient and effective way to implement ideas for the betterment of the 
community.

### Pull request

__Do you want to realize the idea yourself?__
If you believe you have found a way to implement your idea and would like to 
submit a pull request, it is essential to coordinate with us maintainers 
beforehand. This will ensure that your changes align with the project's goals 
and guidelines and can help prevent any potential conflicts or issues. 
Additionally, communicating with us maintainers beforehand will give us an 
opportunity to provide feedback and guidance on your proposed changes, which can 
help improve the overall quality of your pull request.

the criteria outlined in the following checklist.
