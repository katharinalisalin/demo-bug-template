# Docs reporting

The documentation for Material for MkDocs is spread across more than 60 pages 
and covers information about its features, configurations, and everything you 
need to take advantage of Material for MkDocs' full capabilities. If you have 
found a bug or see room for improvement in the documentation, please submit an 
issue to our public  [issue tracker], by following this guide.

  [issue tracker]: https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/issues

## Docs issue template

Reporting something in the documentation differs from reporting a bug in the code. 
Please thoroughly read the following __docs reporting guide__ before creating a 
new issue.

### Title

A great issue title should be a short, one-sentence description of the issue and 
contain all relevant information and keywords  – to simplefy the seach in the 
issue tracker.

| <!-- --> | Example  |
| -------- | -------- | 
| :material-check:{ style="color: #4DB6AC" } __Clear__ | wrong feature flag code.action
| :material-close:{ style="color: #EF5350" } __Unclear__ | Missing information 
| :material-close:{ style="color: #EF5350" } __Generic__ | Please help

### Description

Provide a clear and concise summary of the bug you encountered in the 
documentation or the section of the documentation that needs improvement. Explain 
why you think the documentation should be adjusted and also describe its 
impact. 

-   __Keep it short and concise__ – if the bug and it's impact can be precisely 
    explained in one or two sentences, perfect. Don't eleborate, as maintainers 
    and future users will be grateful for having to read less.

-   __One bug at a time__ – if you encountered multiple unrelated bugs on 
    different sites of the documentation, please create separate issues. Don't 
    report more than one bug in the same issue, as this makes identifying them
    difficult.

> __Why we need this__: for us to understand the problem you have found or the 
> clarification of the documentation needs, we ask for a description and 
> explanation of the impacts.

### Links to the documentation

After you described the section of the documentation that needs to be adjusted
above, we now ask you to provide us with the link to this specific section of the 
documentation. Make sure you link to the sub-pages and anchor the headings 
directly.

> __Why we need this__: providing the link to the documentation helps us 
> understand which sections of our documentation need to be adjusted, extended, 
> or overhauled. 

### Improvement proposals

Now, that you have provided us with the describtion, impact and link to the 
documentation, you can help us maintainers by proposing an improvement. If you 
have found a solution that works for you, you can help other users to 
temporarily fix the problem before we maintainers can update our documentation.

> __Why we need this__: improvement proposals can help us maintainers to 
> work faster and more efficiantly on fixes and therefore benefit the 
> entire community.

### Checklist

Thanks for following the docs reporting guide and creating a high-quality docs 
issue report. This section ensures that you have read this guide and have worked 
to your best knowledge to provide us with every piece information we need to 
improve the Material for MkDocs documentation.

__We'll take it from here.__
