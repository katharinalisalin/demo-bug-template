## Before submitting a feature suggestion



- Open a discussion - pre flight - on the discussion board and ask the community, if the feature 
would benefit more people than yourself





- Make sure it is a feature that needs to be implemented by Material for MkDocs 
- Do other solution, e.g., static site generators or themes, provide this feature? Would be a great showcase


When adding a new feature or changing the behavior of an existing one, the 
following things have to be considered:

- [ ] The new feature is not incompatible with one of the existing features
- [ ] The new feature can (ideally) be used together with all existing features
- [ ] The new feature can be implemented in a way that it is accessible
- [ ] The implementation follows the principle of progressive enhancement
- [ ] The implementation works on all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] The implementation works on all modern browsers (nope, not IE)
- [ ] The new feature can be implemented with reasonable effort
- [ ] The new feature matches the overall "tone" of this project
- [ ] The new feature is useful to the majority of users
- [ ] The new feature is easy to use for authors


- Feature selbst bauen, yes, aber dann stimm dich dringend mit uns ab.


## Feature suggestion guide

Reporting a bug in the documentation differs from reporting a bug in the code. 
Please thoroughly read the following __docs reporting guide__ before creating a 
new issue to report a bug or improvement in the documentation.

### Title

A great issue title should be a short, one-sentence description of the bug and 
contain all relevant information. The title should start with "Docs:" and 
include relevant keywords to make searching for the issue faster for the 
community.

| <!-- --> | Example  |
| -------- | -------- | 
| :material-check:{ style="color: #4DB6AC" } __Clear__ | Feature: feature flag code.action
| :material-close:{ style="color: #EF5350" } __Unclear__ | Feature: build 
| :material-close:{ style="color: #EF5350" } __Generic__ | Bug

### Description

Provide a clear and concise summary of the bug you encountered in the 
[Material for MkDocs documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material).
Explain why you think the documentation contains a bug or needs improvement, and 
also explain its impact. 

-   __Keep it short and concise__ – if the bug and it's impact can be precisely 
    explained in one or two sentences, perfect. Don't eleborate, as maintainers 
    and future users will be grateful for having to read less.

-   __One bug at a time__ – if you encountered multiple unrelated bugs on 
    different sites of the documentation, please create separate issues for them. 
    Don't report them in the same issue, as this makes identifying the bugs difficult.

> __Why we need this__: in order for us to understand the problem you have found 
> or the clarification the documentation needs, we ask for a decription of the bug.


### Related Links

Now, include the link to the specific section of the documentation you described 
above, and make sure you link to the sub-pages and anchor the headings directly.

> __Why we need this__: providing the link to the documentation helps us 
> understand which sections of our documentation need to be adjusted, extended, 
> or overhauled.
