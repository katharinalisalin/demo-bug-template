# Reporting, requesting, exchanging and submitting

Material for MkDocs is an actively maintained and constantly improved project 
that caters to a diverse user base with varying backgrounds and needs. To 
effectively address these needs of all our users, evaluate requests, and fix 
bugs, a lot of work is required. To make this process more efficient, we have 
implemented various options for our users to report, request, submit to the 
project or exchange with the community. The options available are:

## Reporting

If you found a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue
to the [issue tracker] in our GitHub repository. Before doing so, please read 
the bug reporting guidelines for more information on how to submit a useful 
report.


Before doing so, please read the 
[bug reporting guidelines](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/bug-report/)
for more information on how to submit a useful report.

  [issue tracker]: https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/issues

## Requesting

If you would like to request a new feature or change to the project, you can 
submit a change request to our GitHub repository. If you would like to implement 
a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first to be 
sure that it is of use to everyone, as Material for MkDocs is highly 
opinionated. Please consider what kind of change it is:

## Exchanging

If you have questions and want to get in contact with the community, you have 
two options.

- [discussion board]: Our discussion boars the first 
- [gitter.im] - For quick questions, there's no need to open an issue, as you can reach us on

  [discussion board]: https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/discussions
  [gitter.im]: https://gitter.im/squidfunk/mkdocs-material


## Submitting

* For a **major feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so
  that it can be discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our
  efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so
  that it is successfully accepted into the project.

* **Small features and bugs** can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull
  Request. However, there is no guarantee that your feature will make it into
  the `master`, as it's always a matter of opinion whether it benefits the
  overall functionality of the project.
