### Have a change request?

If you would like to request a new feature or change to the project, you can 
submit an issue to our GitHub repository.

If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with a
proposal for your work first to be sure that it is of use to everyone, as
Material for MkDocs is highly opinionated. Please consider what kind of change
it is:

* For a **major feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so
  that it can be discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our
  efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so
  that it is successfully accepted into the project.

* **Small features and bugs** can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull
  Request. However, there is no guarantee that your feature will make it into
  the `master`, as it's always a matter of opinion whether it benefits the
  overall functionality of the project.
