Material for MkDocs is an actively maintained and constantly improved project 
that caters to a diverse user base with varying backgrounds and needs. In order
to effectively address the needs of all our users, evaluate requests, and fix 
bugs, a lot of work from us maintainers is required.

## How to contribute

We have invested quite a lot of time in creating better templates for our
[issue tracker], optimizing the processes for our users to report bugs, request
features or changes, contribute to the project or exchange with our community.
