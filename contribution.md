# Contributing

Material for MkDocs is an actively maintained and constantly improved project 
that serves a diverse user base with varying backgrounds and needs. In order to 
effectively address the needs of all our users, evaluate requests, and fix bugs, 
we maintainers need to put in a lot of work.

## How to contribute

We have devoted significant effort in creating better templates for our
[issue tracker], optimizing the processes for our users to report bugs, request
features or changes, contribute to the project, or exchange with our community. 
Given the wealth of valuable knowledge contained in numerous issues and 
discussions, we consider our issue tracker and discussion board to serve as a 
crucial knowledge base, that is an important addition to our documentation and 
brings value to both new and experienced users of Material for MkDocs. To
maintain the organization, searchability, and ease of use of these knowledge 
bases, it is essential to select the appropriate contribution template. In this 
section of our documentation, we outline the available options and their 
respective procedures.

## Before contributing

Our community is vast and includes many curious people who open new discussions 
or issues multiple times a day and are filling the issue tracker or the 
discussion board with a lot of valuable knowledge. Therefore, we see our issue 
tracker and the discussion board as a knowledge base that is an important

issues and discusion can't be deleted â€“ they will stay in this project _forever_, for _everybody_ to read
