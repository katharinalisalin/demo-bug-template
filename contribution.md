We see our issue tracker and discussion board as a knowledge base where our community and we maintainers share important information for the community.

 It should be easily searchable and a place for our community to share knowledge, solutions, workaround and discuss.

When opening an issue, you should keep the following things in mind:

- discussions are welcome, since it's great step in other point of views, but it's important to do it in a respectful way
- accept decisions, even if it's not going your way
